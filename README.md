Full network flow:
  App → tunX → OpenVPN → SOCKS5:9050 → Tor → Tor relays → VPN server → Internet
```

The GUI and the daemon are **fully decoupled**: the GUI only writes config files and calls systemd. It never monitors processes and cannot interfere with an active connection.

---

## Requirements

| Component | Min version | Role |
|-----------|-------------|------|
| Ubuntu / Debian | 20.04 / 11 | Base system |
| Python | 3.8+ | Daemon + GUI |
| python3-tk | — | GUI toolkit |
| tor | — | SOCKS5 proxy and Tor network |
| openvpn | 2.4+ | Encrypted tunnel to VPN provider |
| dnsmasq | — | DHCP server for LAN sharing |
| curl / dnsutils | — | Connectivity and DNS tests |
| systemd + systemd-resolved | — | Service management and DNS |

**Optional — AI Diagnostics:**
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com) with an LLM model (recommended: `llama3.3:70b`)
- Can point to a remote Ollama instance

---

## Installation

```bash
sudo bash install.sh
```

The installer runs **6 steps**:

**1. Dependencies**
```bash
apt install tor openvpn python3 python3-tk dnsutils dnsmasq curl
```

**2. Configuration directory**
- Creates `/etc/tor-vpn-manager/` with `700` permissions (root only)
- Writes `/etc/tor-vpn-manager/install_dir` (path used by the CLI)
- Auto-migrates any existing config from `/root/.config/tor-vpn-manager/` or `/opt/tor-vpn-manager/`

**3. System services**
- Enables and starts `systemd-resolved`
- **Disables and stops** the system `tor` service — the daemon manages Tor directly as a subprocess for precise control over startup, logs, and restarts

**4. Systemd service**
Creates `/etc/systemd/system/tor-vpn-manager.service`:
- `ExecStartPre`: iptables cleanup script (removes orphan rules from the previous session)
- `ExecStart`: `python3 -m daemon` from the install directory
- `ExecStopPost`: same cleanup script
- `Restart=on-failure` with a 15s delay, max 5 attempts in 5 minutes
- `KillMode=control-group`: systemd kills the entire cgroup (Tor, OpenVPN, dnsmasq included)
- `TimeoutStopSec=30`

**5. Sleep/wake hook**
Installs `/lib/systemd/system-sleep/tor-vpn-sleep`: automatically restarts the daemon 3 seconds after each wake from sleep or hibernation. Without this hook, Tor circuits are stale after wake but port 9050 is still open, causing OpenVPN to reconnect without going through Tor.

**6. CLI and GUI launcher**
- Installs `/usr/local/bin/tor-vpn` (copy of `tor-vpn-cli.sh`)
- Creates `/etc/xdg/autostart/tor-vpn-gui.desktop` (appears in app menus)

## Graphical Interface

### Launch

```bash
tor-vpn gui          # Recommended — pkexec prompts for root password
sudo python3 main.py # Direct launch
```

### Providers Tab

Manages VPN providers and their accounts. List order defines connection and failover priority.

**Provider:**
- Free name (e.g. ProtonVPN, Mullvad)
- Associated `.ovpn` file — copied to `providers/<Name>/` on selection
- ↑ ↓ buttons to reorder priority

**Accounts per provider:**
- Each provider can have multiple accounts (username + password)
- Stored as base64 in `config.json` (simple obfuscation, see [Security](#security))
- ↑ ↓ buttons to reorder; the daemon tries accounts in order

**Automatic failover:** if one account fails, the daemon moves to the next account of the same provider, then to the next provider.

**Import / Export `.tvpn`:** ZIP archive containing `config.json` + all `.ovpn` files. Transfers the complete configuration between machines.

### Exclusions Tab

#### Split DNS — Local domains

Routes DNS queries for specific domains to your local DNS server, while everything else goes through the VPN's DNS.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Local DNS server** | IP of your DNS server (e.g. `10.0.50.253`) |
| **Domains** | Domains to route to this DNS (e.g. `.local`, `.home`) |

> **Important:** the network containing your DNS server must appear in the **Excluded IPs/Networks** below.

#### IPs / Networks excluded from tunnel

CIDRs and IPs that bypass the tunnel and go through the local gateway. The daemon injects `--route <ip> <mask> net_gateway` into the OpenVPN command.

**Typical use cases:**
- Local network (`192.168.1.0/24`)
- DNS server subnet — **required if split DNS is enabled**
- NAS, network printers, local servers

### Settings Tab

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Block IPv6** | disabled | DROP ip6tables on OUTPUT + FORWARD |
| **Auto-reconnect** | enabled | Automatically restarts the tunnel |
| **Min VPN speed (KB/s)** | 100 | Below N times in a row → failover. 0 = disabled |
| **Min Tor speed (KB/s)** | 50 | Below N times in a row → new circuit. 0 = disabled |
| **Consecutive measurements** | 3 | Measurements below threshold before action |
| **Autostart** | disabled | `systemctl enable/disable tor-vpn-manager` |

**"Repair Network" button:** runs `repair_network.sh` manually — stops the service, clears all iptables rules, routes and DNS blocks, then prompts to restart. Useful when the connection is completely stuck despite a service restart.

### LAN Sharing Tab

Shares the Tor+VPN tunnel with devices on a second network interface.

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Interface** | Network card to use (auto-filters lo, tun*, docker*, etc.) |
| **Card IP** | Gateway IP assigned to this interface (e.g. `10.0.0.1`) |
| **CIDR subnet** | DHCP range (e.g. `10.0.0.0/24`) |
| **DHCP server** | Automatically starts dnsmasq |
| **Enable at start** | Starts sharing as soon as the tunnel is active |

### Tor (torrc) Tab

Customizes Tor configuration via a dedicated `torrc` file. If no torrc is defined, Tor starts with the minimal parameters built into the daemon.

**3 preset profiles:**

| Profile | Use case |
|---------|----------|
| **Stable VPN** | Long circuits, active keepalive — recommended for daily use |
| **Enhanced anonymity** | Traffic padding, Five Eyes exclusion, slow rotation |
| **Performance** | Short circuits, aggressive timeout, fast rotation |

**Configurable options:**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `LongLivedPorts 1194,443` | Prefers stable relays for OpenVPN ports |
| `LearnCircuitBuildTimeout 0` | Fixed circuit timeout (more predictable) |
| `MaxCircuitDirtiness` | Max circuit lifetime before renewal (s) |
| `CircuitBuildTimeout` | Max circuit build time (s) |
| `NewCircuitPeriod` | How often new circuits are built (s) |
| `KeepalivePeriod` | Keepalive cells to maintain circuits across NAT |
| `NumEntryGuards` | Number of entry guard nodes |
| `GuardLifetime` | How long to keep guards |
| `AvoidDiskWrites 1` | Reduces disk writes |
| `SafeLogging 1` | Masks IPs in Tor logs |
| `ClientUseIPv6 0` | Disables IPv6 for Tor |
| `TestSocks 1` | Warns on local DNS leak via SOCKS |
| `ConnectionPadding 1` | Traffic analysis resistance (↑ bandwidth) |
| `ExcludeExitNodes` | Exclude exit nodes by country (e.g. `{us},{gb}`) |
| `StrictNodes` | Strict exclusions (may disconnect if no node available) |

**Expert mode:** editable text area showing the full torrc. Updates in real time as options change. Can be edited directly for advanced parameters.

**Apply button** → writes `/etc/tor-vpn-manager/torrc` + restarts the service.  
**Reset button** → deletes the torrc + restarts with the daemon's minimal config.

> Mandatory parameters (`SocksPort`, `ControlPort`, `CookieAuthentication`, `DataDirectory`) are always enforced at apply time.

### AI Diagnostics Tab

GUI for `diag.py`. Collects complete system state and streams it to an LLM via Ollama for analysis.

---

## CLI `tor-vpn`

```bash
# Service control (requires root)
sudo tor-vpn start       # Start the daemon
sudo tor-vpn stop        # Stop the daemon
sudo tor-vpn restart     # Restart the daemon
sudo tor-vpn enable      # Enable autostart at boot
sudo tor-vpn disable     # Disable autostart

# Graphical interface
tor-vpn gui

# Monitoring
tor-vpn status           # Full state: service, Tor, VPN, split DNS, public IP
tor-vpn logs [n]         # Last n lines of journal (default: 60)
tor-vpn follow           # Live logs (Ctrl+C to exit)
tor-vpn ip               # Current public IP

# AI diagnostics
tor-vpn diag                              # Full LLM-analyzed report
tor-vpn diag --collect-only               # Raw report without AI
tor-vpn diag --model llama3.3:70b         # Choose the Ollama model
```

---

## Daemon Internals

### Full startup sequence

```
1.  Clean up orphan iptables rules (from previous session)
2.  Start Tor as a subprocess (with torrc if present)
3.  Wait for Tor 100% bootstrap (240s timeout)
4.  Start the OpenVPN loop in a dedicated thread
5.  Start the monitoring loop in the main thread
```

### Tor management

Tor is launched directly as a subprocess (not via the system service).

**Without custom torrc** (minimal built-in config):
```
--SocksPort 9050  --ControlPort 9051  --CookieAuthentication 0
--DataDirectory /etc/tor-vpn-manager/tor_data  --Log notice stdout
```

**With custom torrc** (created via the GUI Tor tab):
```
tor --torrc-file /etc/tor-vpn-manager/torrc --Log notice stdout
```
`--Log notice stdout` is always appended on the command line so the daemon can detect the bootstrap regardless of torrc settings.

If Tor crashes, it is automatically restarted (up to 5 times with a 15s delay).

### OpenVPN management

```
openvpn
  --config            <file.ovpn>
  --auth-user-pass    /etc/tor-vpn-manager/auth.tmp
  --script-security   2
  --verb              3          ← required for net_addr_v4_add in logs
  --ping              10
  --ping-exit         60
  --connect-timeout   60         ← extended because Tor circuits can be slow
  --connect-retry     1
  --connect-retry-max 1
  --socks-proxy       127.0.0.1 9050
  [--route <ip> <mask> net_gateway ...]
```

**Tor route protection:**
As soon as OpenVPN assigns an IP to the tunnel (`net_addr_v4_add`, visible via `--verb 3`), the daemon **synchronously** adds static `/32` routes for all active Tor guard IPs via the original local gateway. This must happen *before* the `up` script installs `redirect-gateway` routes. Without this protection, Tor would try to reach its guards through the tunnel, creating a loop that kills the connection. Routes are persisted in `/etc/tor-vpn-manager/tor-vpn-routes.txt` and cleanly removed at shutdown.

**Split DNS timing:**
Split DNS is applied **after** `Initialization Sequence Completed`, not at daemon startup. This ensures it is not overwritten by OpenVPN's `update-resolv-conf` script which runs at connection time.

**Connection sequence:**
When `Initialization Sequence Completed` is detected:
1. Split DNS applied (after OpenVPN's up script)
2. IPv6 blocking enabled (if configured)
3. LAN sharing started (if `lan_auto = true`)

### Sleep/wake hook

`/lib/systemd/system-sleep/tor-vpn-sleep` is called by the kernel on every sleep/wake event. On wake (`post`), it waits 3 seconds then runs `systemctl restart tor-vpn-manager`. This delay gives network interfaces time to reconnect before the daemon relaunches Tor.

---

## iptables Chains

The daemon creates **dedicated named chains** for clean teardown without interfering with other rules.

### IPv6 blocking — `TORVPN_KS6` / `TORVPN_KS6_FWD`

```
OUTPUT/FORWARD:
RETURN  → lo
RETURN  → tunX
RETURN  → ESTABLISHED,RELATED
DROP    → everything else (IPv6)
```

Protects against IPv6 leaks when the VPN provider does not support it.

### LAN sharing — `TORVPN_LAN_FWD` (FORWARD)

```
RETURN  → ESTABLISHED,RELATED
RETURN  → <lan_iface> → tunX
DROP    → <lan_iface> → everything else

NAT POSTROUTING: MASQUERADE source=<lan_subnet> out=tunX
```

---

## Failover & Watchdog

### Failure detection

The watchdog checks connectivity every **9 seconds** (after a **30-second grace period** post-connection):

1. `ip link show tunX` — does the interface exist?
2. TCP connection to `1.1.1.1:443` via `SO_BINDTODEVICE tunX` (5s timeout) — does the tunnel actually route traffic?

If the check fails **2 times in a row** (~28s max): `_full_restart()` — full Tor + OpenVPN shutdown, orphan `/32` route cleanup, full restart.

If connectivity returns after a restart, the counter resets.

### Automatic emergency repair

If **3 consecutive full restarts** all fail (`_full_restart_count`), the watchdog triggers `_emergency_repair()`:

```
1. Runs repair_network.sh --internal
   → cleans iptables (IPv6 + LAN), blocked OpenVPN routes, systemd-resolved DNS
   → does not touch the systemd service (the daemon stays in control)
2. sys.exit(1)
   → systemd detects the crash and automatically relaunches the daemon (Restart=on-failure)
```

**Typical log sequence during a total block:**
```
[WARN] Watchdog: no connectivity (1/2) …
[WARN] Watchdog: no connectivity (2/2) …
[ERROR] Watchdog: full restart (1/3) …
[WARN] Watchdog: no connectivity (1/2) …
[ERROR] Watchdog: full restart (2/3) …
[WARN] Watchdog: no connectivity (1/2) …
[ERROR] Watchdog: full restart (3/3) …
[ERROR] 3 failed restarts — running repair_network.sh …
[WARN]  Repair done — exiting for systemd relaunch.
← systemd automatically relaunches the daemon
```

### Low throughput detection

- **Low VPN throughput** N times in a row → failover to next account/provider
- **Low Tor throughput** N times in a row → `SIGNAL NEWNYM`: Tor builds a new circuit

### Failover logic

```
Provider 1, Account 1 → Provider 1, Account 2 → ... → Provider 2, Account 1 → ...
All exhausted → back to start → give up after 5 attempts
```

### Clean shutdown (SIGTERM / SIGINT)

```
1. SIGTERM → OpenVPN
2. SIGTERM → Tor
3. Remove Tor /32 routes
4. Teardown LAN sharing + stop dnsmasq
5. Remove ip6tables chains
6. Remove split DNS drop-in
7. Remove auth.tmp
```

---

## LAN Sharing

When LAN sharing is enabled:

1. Gateway IP assigned to the LAN interface (`ip addr add`)
2. IP routing enabled (`sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1`)
3. NAT MASQUERADE so LAN traffic exits through the tunnel
4. `TORVPN_LAN_FWD` chain: blocks all LAN traffic not heading to the tunnel
5. dnsmasq in `--no-daemon` mode: DHCP in the subnet, DNS `1.1.1.1` through the tunnel

If the tunnel drops, LAN traffic is blocked — no leak through the direct connection.

---

## Split DNS — Local Domains

Lets you reach services on your local network with a custom domain name **while the VPN is active**.

### Why it is needed

Without split DNS, OpenVPN's `redirect-gateway def1` routes all traffic through the tunnel — including packets to your local DNS server, which becomes unreachable.

With split DNS:
- `.local` → your local DNS (`10.0.50.253`)
- Everything else → VPN DNS through Tor

### Configuration

**In the GUI Exclusions tab:**

1. Enter the local DNS server IP
2. Add local domains (e.g. `.local`, `.home`)
3. Add the DNS subnet to excluded IPs (e.g. `10.0.50.0/24`) — **critical step**
4. Save + Restart

The daemon automatically generates:

```ini
# /etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d/tor-vpn-split.conf
[Resolve]
DNS=10.0.50.253
Domains=~local
```

### Verification

```bash
resolvectl status            # see routed domains
dig server.local             # must resolve via 10.0.50.253
tor-vpn status               # shows "Split DNS: active (→ 10.0.50.253)"
```

---

## Tor Configuration (torrc)

The **Tor (torrc)** tab generates and writes `/etc/tor-vpn-manager/torrc`. If this file exists, the daemon passes it to Tor via `--torrc-file`. If absent, Tor starts with the minimal built-in arguments.

### Mandatory parameters (always present)

```ini
SocksPort 9050
ControlPort 9051
CookieAuthentication 0
DataDirectory /etc/tor-vpn-manager/tor_data
```

### Stable VPN profile (recommended)

```ini
LongLivedPorts 1194,443
LearnCircuitBuildTimeout 0
MaxCircuitDirtiness 3600
CircuitBuildTimeout 60
NewCircuitPeriod 60
KeepalivePeriod 60
NumEntryGuards 3
GuardLifetime 2 months
AvoidDiskWrites 1
SafeLogging 1
ClientUseIPv6 0
TestSocks 1
```

### Enhanced anonymity profile

```ini
# All of Stable VPN +
ConnectionPadding 1
NewCircuitPeriod 120
ExcludeExitNodes {us},{gb},{ca},{au},{nz}
StrictNodes 0
```

### Performance profile

```ini
LongLivedPorts 1194,443
LearnCircuitBuildTimeout 0
MaxCircuitDirtiness 600
CircuitBuildTimeout 15
NewCircuitPeriod 30
KeepalivePeriod 30
NumEntryGuards 2
GuardLifetime 1 months
AvoidDiskWrites 1
```

### Reset

The **Reset** button deletes the torrc file. On the next service start, Tor runs with minimal parameters and no external config file.

---

## Automatic Network Repair

`repair_network.sh` is the emergency recovery script. It can be triggered in **three ways**:

| Trigger | Mode | Behavior |
|---------|------|----------|
| GUI "Repair Network" button | manual | Stops service, cleans everything, prompts to restart |
| `sudo bash repair_network.sh` | manual CLI | Same as GUI button |
| Watchdog (3 failed restarts) | automatic | `--internal`: cleans without `systemctl stop`, then `sys.exit(1)` for systemd relaunch |

**What the script cleans:**

1. Residual OpenVPN and Tor processes (`pkill`)
2. ip6tables chains `TORVPN_KS6` (IPv6 blocking)
3. iptables chains `TORVPN_LAN_FWD` (LAN sharing)
4. systemd-resolved DNS — removes the drop-in and restarts `systemd-resolved`
5. Blocked OpenVPN def1 routes (`0.0.0.0/1`, `128.0.0.0/1`, `default` on tun0)
6. Final connectivity check (`ip route get 1.1.1.1`, `getent ahosts`)

---

## AI Diagnostics

`diag.py` collects 24 sections of system data (systemd service, Tor, OpenVPN, network interfaces, routing table, iptables, DNS, logs, public IP…) and sends them to an LLM via Ollama for analysis.

```bash
tor-vpn diag                              # full analysis
tor-vpn diag --collect-only               # raw data without AI
tor-vpn diag --model llama3.3:70b         # choose the model
tor-vpn diag --url http://host:11434      # custom Ollama URL
```

The response is displayed in **streaming** (token by token) in the terminal or GUI window.

---

## config.json Format

`/etc/tor-vpn-manager/config.json` — mode `600`, root only.

## Security

**VPN credentials:** stored as base64 in `config.json`. This is obfuscation, **not encryption**. The file is mode `600` — accessible by root only.

**auth.tmp:** written as mode `600` just before launching OpenVPN, deleted in the `finally` block as soon as OpenVPN has read the file.

**torrc:** written as mode `600` — root only.

**Tor as proxy:** the VPN server sees a Tor exit node IP, never your real IP. Your ISP sees that you use Tor, but does not know you are using a VPN or what destination you are reaching.

## Getting Started

```bash
# 1. Install
sudo bash install.sh

# 2. Open the configuration interface
tor-vpn gui

# 3. Providers tab:
#    a. "+ Add" → provider name
#    b. "Choose / Change" → select your .ovpn file
#    c. "+ Add account" → username + password

# 4. (Optional) Tor (torrc) tab:
#    - Select the "Stable VPN" profile
#    - Click "Apply + Restart"

# 5. (Optional) Exclusions tab:
#    - Local DNS + domains + DNS subnet in excluded IPs

# 6. Save

# 7. Start
sudo tor-vpn start

# 8. Follow the startup
tor-vpn follow
# Wait for "VPN tunnel active." (Tor bootstrap = 1-3 minutes)

# 9. Verify
tor-vpn status
```

## Uninstallation

```bash
sudo tor-vpn stop
sudo systemctl disable tor-vpn-manager
sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/tor-vpn-manager.service
